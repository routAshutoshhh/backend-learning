create a backend logic for the server 
which is connected to databases


in that  we need to do the following things-

1. create a route where we need to send the data to the database which the user send provided that already does not exits the database
 as the data is - username  and password - /signup

2. our backend will check if the user  already exits in the  database and if the user already exits then send them  back  the jwt else not 
    - /signin

3. final route that we need to deal with 
    - /users
    send the token  in the header and verify the token and send back the user details

- library we going to use is - mongoose as it can do mongodb validation as it is schema less
